A Serialize script that can freely convert a list of bytes with arbitrary objects, like JSON.
The difference with Json is that it can complete the save and read an object, and do not need to use the key to get the value, just as the object itself is so simple

You can open the Test scene, or refer to the sample content of the Test script!

Thank you for your use!
